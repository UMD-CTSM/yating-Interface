     <p>The objectives of this projects are to (1) implement and use a network analysis Python computer code, designed to
         quantifying the topological connectedness efficiency of freight railroad
         networks for resilience studies; (2) design the architecture of a Tool for Rail Network Topological Analysis
         and Throughput Assessment (RailNTA) and; (3) use aggregate network to illustrate the methodology and the tools, and
         offer a proof of concept in coordination with FRA and industry partners.</p>

     <h3>Terminology</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Node efficiency</b> of a node <i>i</i> characterizes how well products are transported by
       its neighbors when <i>i</i> is removed. It is calculated as the average of all node pairwise efficiency
        values between node <i>i</i> and other nodes.</li>
       <li><b>Node eccentricity</b> of a node <i>i</i> is the maximum distance from <i>i</i>
        to any other node. The reciprocal of eccentricity is an indicator for the importance of a node within a network.</li>
       <li><b>Hazard</b> is a source of potential harm or a condition that may result from an external cause (e.g., earthquake,
          flood, or human agency) or an internal vulnerability, with the potential to initiate a failure mode.</li>
       <li><b>Fragility</b> is the conditional probability of failure at a particular hazard level.</li>
       <li><b>Likelihood</b> is the chance of something happening, whether defined, measured, or determined objectively or subjectively,
          qualitatively, or quantitatively, and described using general terms or mathematically, such as a probability or a
           frequency over a given time period.</li>
       <li><b>Probability</b> is a measure of chance of occurrence, likelihood, odds, or degree of belief that a particular outcome
          or event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is impossibility and 1 is absolute certainty.
           This measure meets the axioms of probability theory. Probability has at least two primary interpretations: (1) a
            frequency representing the occurrence fraction of an outcome in repeated trials or an experiment as sometimes termed
             an objective probability and (2) subjective probability that is based on the state of knowledge.</li>
       <li><b>Resilience</b> is defined by several sources as (1) the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly
          recover from disruption due to emergencies. (2) the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and to withstand
           and recover rapidly from disruptions. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks,
            accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents. (3) the persistence of a corresponding functional performance
             under uncertainty in the face of disturbances. The third definition is consistent with the risk definition of the
              “effect of uncertainty on objectives.”</li>
       <li><b>Risk</b> should be associated with a system and is commonly defined as the potential loss resulting from an uncertain exposure
          to a hazard or resulting from an uncertain event that exploits the system’s vulnerability. Risk should be based on identified
           risk events or event scenarios. A broadly applicable definition of risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives
            in order to cover the following considerations: (1) An effect is a deviation from the expected that can be positive and/or
             negative effect. (2) Objectives can have different aspects, such as financial, health and safety, and environmental goals,
              and can apply at different levels, such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product, and process. (3) Risk is often
               expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event, including changes in circumstances, and the associated
                likelihood of occurrence as provided in the commonly used definition.</li>
      <li><b>System</b> is a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements, such as people, property, materials, environment,
         and processes.</li>

     <h2 style="text-align:center">Case Study: Class I Railroads</h2>
     <p> In the United States, railroads are designated as Class I, Class II, or Class III, according to size criteria
        first established by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1911, and now governed by the Surface
         Transportation Board (STB). The STB's current definition of a Class I railroad is that any
          carrier earns annual revenue greater than $250 million. This number should be adjusted for inflation and was most
           recently set to $504,803,294 in 2019. Zoom in to see the deatils of the railroad facilities.</p>

     <h2 style="text-align:center">Case Study: Union Pacific Railroads</h2>
     <p> Union Pacific (UP) is the largest railroad in North America, covering 23 states
       in the western two-thirds of the United States. The graph below shows
        31,920 nodes within the network and node eccentricity values.
       We are interested in the node(s) with the smallest eccentricity value because those nodes are usually more central,
         while nodes with higher eccentricity are usually more peripheral.</p>
     <div id='eccentricity'></div>
     <div id='table'></div>


     <p> The graph below shows node efficienecy values of the UP network. We are interested in the node(s) with the
     largest effeciency value because those nodes are able to reach all other nodes at a short
      distance. Generally, more central nodes connected in a grid-like pattern
       will have a greater node efficiency than those in long chains or at the periphery of a network.</p>
